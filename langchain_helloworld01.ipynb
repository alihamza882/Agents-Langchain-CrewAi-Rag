            "* **Chain together actions:** Instead of just asking the AI one question, you can use Langchain to create a series of steps. For example, you could:\n",
            "    1. Ask the AI to summarize a document.\n",
            "    2. Then, ask it to extract key information from the summary.\n",

            "* **Give the AI access to external data:** AI models are trained on a lot of data, but sometimes you need them to use specific, up-to-date information. Langchain can help you connect the AI to things like:\n",

            "    * **Databases:** To get specific information.\n",
